The databases and codes are provided to reproduce the results reported in our AAAI15 Paper. 

Xi Peng, Zhang Yi, and Huajin Tang. 
Robust Subspace Clustering via Thresholding Ridge Regression. 
The Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Austin, Texas, USA, January 25--29, 2015.

If you would like to reproduce the result, please assign the parameters with the value reported in the paper, otherwise, specify some possible values for the parameters.

If you used the codes or data sets, please approximately cite our works.


========================Configuration========================
---The codes were produced in MATLAB2012a 64 bit. 

-The Accuracy and NMI may fluctuate in the range of [-1% 1%] owing to effects of k-means clustering method.

========================Data========================
Some used data sets. 


======================== usages ========================
Some codes sharing by the tested methods.
1. accuracy.m: calculate the clustering Accuracy of the tested method;
2. nmi.m: calculate the NMI of the tested method;
3. CalMetricOfCluster.m: compute the clustering quality of the tested method;
4. BuildAdjacency.m: build a graph using $k$-nearest neighbors;
5. Eigenface_f.m and FeatureEx.m: reduce the dim. of the data using PCA;
6. hungarian.m: best map between predict label and ground truth;
7. litekmeans.m: k-means clustering algorithm;
8. SC.m: normalized spectral clustering algorithm.


========================0-TRR========================
The implementation of our method, i.e., Thresholding Ridge Regression. 

1. TRR_main.m: the main file of TRR, please set the parameters in this file;
2. L2_code_vector.m: encode and cluster the given data set by TRR.
3. AnalyzeResult_L2_ImgClustering.m: As the name implies, run it to analyze the result of TRR with different parameter combinations.
